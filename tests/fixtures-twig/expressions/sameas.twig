Test: Twig supports the "same as" operator

{{ 1 is same as(1) ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is same as 1 ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is not same as(true) ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is not same as true ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is same as(1) ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is not same as(true) ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is   same    as   (1) ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is   same    as   1 ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is  not  same    as   '1' ? 'OK' }}
{{ 1 is not
    same
    as
    (true) ? 'OK' }}
