Test: "autoescape" tag applies escaping after calling filters



(escape_and_nl2br is an escaper filter)

1. Don't escape escaper filter output
( var is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added, 
  the output is not escaped )
{$var|escape_and_nl2br}

2. Don't escape escaper filter output
( var is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added, 
  the output is not escaped, |raw is redundant )
{$var|escape_and_nl2br}

3. Explicit escape
( var is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added,
  the output is explicitly escaped by |escape )
{$var|escape_and_nl2br}

4. Escape non-escaper filter output
( var is upper-cased by |upper,
  the output is auto-escaped )
{$var|upper}

5. Escape if last filter is not an escaper
( var is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added,
  the output is upper-cased by |upper,
  the output is auto-escaped as |upper is not an escaper )
{$var|escape_and_nl2br|upper}

6. Don't escape escaper filter output
( var is upper cased by upper,
  the output is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added,
  the output is not escaped as |escape_and_nl2br is an escaper )
{$var|upper|escape_and_nl2br}

7. Escape if last filter is not an escaper
( the output of |format is "<b>" ~ var ~ "</b>",
  the output is auto-escaped )
{="<b>%s</b>"|format:$var}

8. Escape if last filter is not an escaper
( the output of |format is "<b>" ~ var ~ "</b>",
  |raw is redundant,
  the output is auto-escaped )
{="<b>%s</b>"|format:$var}

9. Don't escape escaper filter output
( the output of |format is "<b>" ~ var ~ "</b>",
  the output is not escaped due to |raw filter at the end )
{="<b>%s</b>"|format:$var}

10. Don't escape escaper filter output
( the output of |format is "<b>" ~ var ~ "</b>",
  the output is not escaped due to |raw filter at the end,
  the |raw filter on var is redundant )
{="<b>%s</b>"|format:$var}
