Test: "autoescape" tag handles filters preserving the safety



(preserves_safety is preserving safety for "html")

1. Unsafe values are still unsafe
( var|preserves_safety|escape )
{$var|preserves_safety}

2. Safe values are still safe
( var|escape|preserves_safety )
{$var|preserves_safety}

3. Re-escape values that are escaped for an other contexts
( var|escape_something|preserves_safety|escape )
{$var|escape_something|preserves_safety}

4. Still escape when using filters not declared safe
( var|escape|preserves_safety|replace({'FABIEN': 'FABPOT'})|escape )
{$var|preserves_safety|replace:[FABIEN => FABPOT]}
