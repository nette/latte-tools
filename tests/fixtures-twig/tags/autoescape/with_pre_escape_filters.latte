Test: "autoescape" tag applies escaping after calling filters, and before calling pre_escape filters



(nl2br is pre_escaped for "html" and declared safe for "html")

1. Pre-escape and don't post-escape
( var|escape|nl2br )
{$var|nl2br}

2. Don't double-pre-escape
( var|escape|nl2br )
{$var|nl2br}

3. Don't escape safe values
( var|raw|nl2br )
{$var|nl2br}

4. Don't escape safe values
( var|escape|nl2br|nl2br )
{$var|nl2br|nl2br}

5. Re-escape values that are escaped for an other contexts
( var|escape_something|escape|nl2br )
{$var|escape_something|nl2br}

6. Still escape when using filters not declared safe
( var|escape|nl2br|upper|escape )
{$var|nl2br|upper}
